# Reentrancy Example
An extremely simple version of a reentrancy attack, for educational purposes.

# How to Use
Recreate the two contracts in remix.ethereum.org and you are ready to go.

## More specifically
1. Navigate your browser to [Remix web IDE](remix.ethereum.org).
2. Create a new file in your Remix workspace called InsecureVault.sol and paste the code from the corresponding file in this repo.
3. Complete step 2 with Attack.sol as well.
4. You're ready! We'll cover the rest in class.

# Why
I know, it's not very efficient. However, doing this in Remix just saves a lot of time troubleshooting potential differences in everyone's development environment during live classes.
